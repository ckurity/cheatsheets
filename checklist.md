### üîê SSO Access via OKTA + AD Integration

Most applications are integrated with **SSO via OKTA**, backed by **Active Directory (AD) groups**.
To gain access to an application, submit a **ServiceNow request** to be added to the corresponding AD group.

In some cases, additional confirmation or approval is required from the **Service Provider (SP)** team.

| **App Name**        | **Required AD Group**     | **Notes**                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

| Jira / Confluence   | `AD-ATLASSIAN-USERS`      | No SP confirmation needed                      |
| WAF Admin Portal    | `AD-WAF-OPS-ADMIN`        | Approval required from `alice.lee@company.com` |
| API Gateway Console | `AD-API-GW-OPS`           | Requires `john.doe@company.com` to confirm     |
| Snowflake           | `AD-DATA-ANALYTICS-USERS` | Requires Data Analytics team approval          |
| SentinelOne Console | `AD-SEC-ENDPOINT-OPS`     | Security Ops approval required                 |

üìù **To Request Access:**

1. Go to [ServiceNow Portal](https://servicenow.company.com)
2. Choose: *Access Management ‚Üí Request Group Membership*
3. Search for the AD group (e.g., `AD-GITHUB-ENG-ACCESS`)
4. Add justification and select your manager
5. Submit the request

### üßæ Sample ServiceNow Request Justification

SP Contact: John Doe (john.doe@company.com) for approval
