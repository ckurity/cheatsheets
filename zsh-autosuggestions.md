## TL;DR
```sh

```

## Install ZSH
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### Before
```sh
$ nl /etc/shells 
     1	# /etc/shells: valid login shells
     2	/bin/sh
     3	/usr/bin/sh
     4	/bin/bash
     5	/usr/bin/bash
     6	/bin/rbash
     7	/usr/bin/rbash
     8	/usr/bin/dash
```

### Installation
```sh
$ sudo apt install zsh
```

### After
```sh
$ nl /etc/shells 
     1	# /etc/shells: valid login shells
     2	/bin/sh
     3	/usr/bin/sh
     4	/bin/bash
     5	/usr/bin/bash
     6	/bin/rbash
     7	/usr/bin/rbash
     8	/usr/bin/dash
     9	/bin/zsh     ðŸ‘ˆ # NEW
    10	/usr/bin/zsh ðŸ‘ˆ # NEW
    11	/usr/bin/zsh ðŸ‘ˆ # NEW
```

After installation, restart your terminal. Zsh with Oh My Zsh provides command completion and autosuggestions.

## Enable the zsh-autosuggestions Plugin
1. Open ~/.zshrc
2. Locate the plugins line and add zsh-autosuggestions to the list. It should look something like this:
```sh
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions)
```

## Install zsh-autosuggestions Manually
If the autosuggestions plugin is not working as expected, you may need to install it manually:
```sh
# Clone the zsh-autosuggestions Repository
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

# Reload Your Zsh Configuration
source ~/.zshrc
```
